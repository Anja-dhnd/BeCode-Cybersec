# TT-nooby-habits

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This repository contains the code I showed during a TechTalk I gave at my cybersecurity bootcamp. The topic was the bad habits that programmers might have when coding in Python. It is aimed at, as you guessed it, programmers but also cybersecurity students since Python has a crucial role in this area. Even if they don't code, recognizing bad code is important. 

Cheers!
